A quick and dirty fix to make music disc sounds global like the "music" and "ambient" sound categories.

"Stereo Jukebox" -> Makes jukeboxes play in both ears instead of just one (depending on direction).
- Direction should have no effect on which ear jukebox music plays in.
- Make volume depend exactly on distance from jukebox? Configurable
- Make music fade out when near a jukebox?
